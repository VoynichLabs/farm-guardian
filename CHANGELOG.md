# Changelog

All notable changes to Farm Guardian are documented here. Follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed — Stabilization & Cleanup (Claude Opus 4.6)

- **config.json** — Reset `confidence_threshold` from 0.99 → 0.45, restoring detection.
  Scrubbed real camera password and Discord webhook from tracked config (now `.gitignore`d).

- **`.gitignore`** — Added `.claude/` to existing ignore rules.

- **`discovery.py`** — Camera RTSP URLs containing credentials are now masked in log
  output (`rtsp://admin:***@...`). Previously, the plaintext password was logged every
  5 minutes during camera rescans.

- **`capture.py`** — Switched RTSP transport from UDP to TCP via
  `OPENCV_FFMPEG_CAPTURE_OPTIONS=rtsp_transport;tcp`. HEVC over WiFi/UDP was dropping
  every ~30 seconds due to packet loss and MTU fragmentation. Also set 5-second read
  timeout (down from 30s default) to speed up reconnection after stream drops.

- **`tracker.py`** — Ghost tracks (single-frame false positives) are now deleted from
  the DB when they close with fewer detections than `min_detections_for_track` (default 2).
  Previously, bear/dog flickers created 0.0s-duration, 1-detection tracks that polluted
  the database.

- **`database.py`** — Added `delete_track()` method for ghost track cleanup.

- **`guardian.py`** — Added `python-dotenv` integration. Secrets (camera password,
  Discord webhook, eBird API key) are now loaded from `.env` and overlaid onto
  `config.json` at startup. Env vars take precedence over config file values,
  so `config.json` can stay sanitized in git while `.env` holds real credentials.

- **`.env` / `.env.example`** — Created `.env` for local secrets (camera password,
  Discord webhook, eBird API key, Cloudflare Tunnel token). `.env.example` committed
  as a template. Both `.env` and `config.json` are `.gitignore`d.

- **`requirements.txt`** — Added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0`.

### Phase C — WIP Commit Review

- Reviewed all 969 lines across 7 files in the WIP commit (edab3c5). All changes are
  complete and production-ready: dashboard redesign (Bloomberg-terminal aesthetic),
  camera_control port fix, dashboard DB queries, CHANGELOG entry. No reverts needed.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed — PTZ + Dashboard Overhaul (Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Opus 4.6)

- **camera_control.py** — Fixed port from 443 → 80 for Reolink HTTP API. Fixed `connect_camera()`
  to construct `Host()` inside the async event loop thread (resolves "no running event loop" error).
  Fixed `ptz_move()` to use reolink_aio direction strings (Left/Right/Up/Down/ZoomInc/ZoomDec)
  instead of pan/tilt/zoom float params. Added speed fallback — camera "FarmGuardian1" doesn't
  support speed parameter, retry without it.

- **dashboard.py** — `get_status()` now queries DB directly for `detections_today` and `alerts_today`
  instead of relying on in-memory buffers that reset to 0 on restart. `/api/detections/recent`
  falls back to DB when in-memory buffer is empty.

- **static/index.html + app.js** — Full dashboard redesign: killed fat stat cards, replaced with
  compact single-line status bar (uptime, frames, detections, last detection). Camera feed (63%)
  + PTZ d-pad panel (37%) side by side. Compact detections table below feed (12 rows max).
  Sidebar collapsed to 44px icon-only. Bloomberg-terminal aesthetic. All info on one screen.

### Operational Note
- Detection paused at 22:08 EDT 03-April-2026 (confidence set to 0.99) while camera is
  temporarily placed in nesting box inside coop. Re-enable by setting confidence back to 0.45.

## [2.0.0-beta] - 2026-04-03

### Added — Phase 3: Camera Control + Deterrence (Claude Opus 4.6)

- **`camera_control.py` (enhanced)** — Added timed spotlight/siren helpers (`spotlight_timed`,
  `siren_timed`) for auto-off after duration. Patrol loop now accepts a `pause_event` so
  the deterrent engine can pause patrol during active predator tracking and resume after.

- **`deterrent.py`** — Automated deterrent response engine with 4 escalation levels:
  Level 0 (log only), Level 1 (spotlight), Level 2 (spotlight + audio alarm),
  Level 3 (spotlight + siren + audio alarm). Per-species response rules configurable in
  config.json. Enforces cooldown between activations per species (default 5 min).
  Tracks effectiveness — monitors whether animal leaves within 60s of deterrent.
  Pauses PTZ patrol during active deterrence. All actions logged to deterrent_actions table.

- **`ebird.py`** — eBird API polling for regional raptor activity near Hampton CT.
  Polls Cornell Lab's eBird Recent Observations API every 30 minutes during hawk hours
  (8am-4pm). Sends Discord alerts for HIGH/MEDIUM threat raptors with 2-hour cooldown.
  Logs all sightings to ebird_sightings table. Tracks 10 raptor species with threat levels.

### Added — Phase 4: Intelligence + Reporting (Claude Opus 4.6)

- **`reports.py`** — Daily intelligence report generator. Queries SQLite for detection
  counts, species breakdown, predator visit summaries, deterrent effectiveness, hourly
  activity distribution, and 7-day trends. Exports to data/exports/ as JSON and Markdown.
  Can run on-demand via API/dashboard or automatically at end of day.

- **`api.py`** — REST API at /api/v1/ for LLM tool access. Endpoints: status, daily
  summaries, detection queries, track queries, species patterns, deterrent effectiveness,
  eBird sightings, camera PTZ/spotlight/siren control, and report export. Mounted on
  the same FastAPI app as the dashboard.

### Changed

- **`guardian.py`** — Wires all Phase 3+4 modules into the service lifecycle. Connects
  camera hardware control on startup, starts PTZ patrol thread with pause support, starts
  eBird polling thread, registers API router on dashboard. Detection callback now fires
  deterrents on predator tracks. Generates end-of-day report on shutdown.

- **`dashboard.py`** — Added PTZ control endpoints (move, stop, preset, spotlight, siren),
  deterrent status endpoint, active tracks endpoint, report endpoints (list dates, load,
  generate on-demand). Updated start_dashboard to accept db/reports and register API router.

- **`database.py`** — Added deterrent action CRUD (insert, update result, get actions,
  effectiveness stats). Added detection aggregation queries (counts by class, by hour,
  predator tracks for date). Added species pattern analysis query. Added eBird sighting
  queries and alert marking.

- **`static/index.html`** — Added PTZ Control page (manual directional pad, zoom, preset
  buttons, spotlight/siren controls, deterrent status, active tracks). Added Reports page
  (date picker, generate button, summary cards, species bar chart, predator visit table,
  hourly activity histogram).

- **`static/app.js`** — Added PTZ control functions (move, stop, zoom, presets, spotlight,
  siren). Added Reports page functions (date loading, report rendering with charts).

- **`config.example.json`** — Added `deterrent`, `ptz`, `ebird`, and `reports` config
  sections with all configurable parameters.

### Why

Phase 3 enables the camera to actively deter predators (not just detect them) with
automated spotlight, siren, and PTZ response. Phase 4 provides intelligence reporting
so the system tracks patterns over time and exposes structured data for LLM queries.

## [2.0.0-alpha] - 2026-04-03

### Added — Phase 2: Database + Vision + Tracking (Claude Opus 4.6)

- **`database.py`** — SQLite abstraction layer with WAL mode for concurrent read access.
  Schema includes 8 tables: cameras, detections, tracks, alerts, deterrent_actions,
  ptz_presets, daily_summaries, ebird_sightings. Thread-safe with parameterized SQL.
  Daily backup to `data/backups/` using SQLite backup API. No ORM — raw SQL for
  PostgreSQL portability.

- **`vision.py`** — GLM vision model species refinement via LM Studio (OpenAI-compatible
  API at 127.0.0.1:1234). When YOLO detects an ambiguous class (bird/cat/dog), crops
  the bounding box and sends to `zai-org/glm-4.6v-flash` for species identification.
  Distinguishes hawk from chicken, bobcat from house cat, coyote from dog. Per-track
  caching prevents redundant queries. 3-second timeout with graceful fallback.

- **`tracker.py`** — Animal visit tracking. Groups individual detections into "tracks"
  (visits) with duration, detection count, confidence stats, and outcome tracking.
  Tracks open on first detection, merge within a 60s timeout window, and close
  automatically when the animal leaves. Provides hooks for deterrent outcome tracking
  (Phase 3).

### Changed

- **`logger.py`** — Now dual-writes to SQLite database (v2) and JSONL files (v1 legacy).
  Accepts optional `db` parameter; backward-compatible when no DB provided. Passes
  track_id, model_name, and bbox_area_pct to DB for richer detection records.

- **`guardian.py`** — Wires new v2 modules into the detection pipeline. After YOLO
  detection, optionally refines species via vision model, then tracks the detection
  as part of an animal visit. Registers cameras in DB after discovery. Daily DB backup
  added to cleanup loop. Graceful shutdown closes tracker and database.

- **`config.example.json`** — Added `vision`, `tracking`, and `database` config sections.

- **`requirements.txt`** — Added `reolink-aio>=0.9.0` and `aiohttp>=3.9.0` (Phase 3 prep).

### Why

Camera arriving 03-April-2026. Phase 2 establishes the structured data foundation so
every detection from day one is stored in SQLite with species refinement and visit
tracking — not just flat JSONL. This enables the intelligence features (reports, patterns,
LLM queries) planned for Phase 4.
