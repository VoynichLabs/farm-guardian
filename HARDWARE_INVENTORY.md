# Hardware Inventory — Farm Guardian Cameras

**Last verified end-to-end:** 2026-04-19 ET (Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) — v2.28.x, `iphone-cam` opportunistic camera added; fleet is four always-on cameras + iPhone when plugged in)
**Why this file exists:** The frontend devs found camera-name mismatches (the backend said `gwtc` while the stream URL said `nestbox`; thumbnail labels said "Brooder" for three different cameras pointed at the brooder). This is the single source of truth for the **hardware** side: what each camera is, what machine hosts it, where its frames flow, and the naming rules that prevent the mismatches from reappearing. If something here disagrees with `config.json`, a source file, or a frontend registry, **this file is the ground truth you bring the others in line with** — not the other way around. Re-verify the "Last verified" stamp any time you change a camera.

## The Four Cameras (was five until 2026-04-15 09:16 ET when `mba-cam` was decommissioned — MBA repurposed by Boss; see note after the table)

| `name` (config) | Camera hardware | Host machine | Host IP | Source URL (how Guardian pulls) | Capture method | Detection | Currently aimed at |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `house-yard` | Reolink E1 Outdoor Pro (4K, PTZ, ONVIF, WiFi) | _itself — standalone IP camera_ | `192.168.0.88` | HTTP snapshot: `http://192.168.0.88/cgi-bin/api.cgi?cmd=Snap&...` (via the `reolink-aio` library; native 4K JPEG) | `source: snapshot`, `snapshot_method: reolink` | **on** (predator detection; night window 20:00-09:00 ET runs 2s polls, daytime runs 5s polls) | The yard, sky, and coop approach |
| `s7-cam` | Samsung Galaxy S7 phone (SM-G930F, Android 8.0.0) running IP Webcam by Pavel Khlebovich (`com.pas.webcam` v1.14.37.759 aarch64) | _itself_ | `192.168.0.249` | `http://192.168.0.249:8080/photo.jpg` — HTTP snapshot pull, 1920×1080 JPEG (~950 KB/frame) | `http_url` snapshot poll via `HttpUrlSnapshotSource` (v2.24.0, 5 s cadence) | off | Coop area |
| `usb-cam` | Generic USB webcam (1920×1080), portable — plug it into whichever host | Any host running the `usb-cam-host` service. **Currently Mac Mini "Bubba"** (moved back from the MBA at 2026-04-14 21:40 ET — MBA was intended as the home but for now USB lives on the Mini). | `192.168.0.71:8089` | `http://192.168.0.71:8089/photo.jpg` — HTTP snapshot pull, 1920×1080 JPEG via the `usb-cam-host` **continuous-capture** FastAPI service (v2.27.0) at `tools/usb-cam-host/usb_cam_host.py`. Daemon grabber thread keeps camera open for service lifetime, reads at ~2 Hz, publishes latest frame to a lock-protected slot; requests copy the latest frame + WB + JPEG in ~75 ms (vs ~3.4 s open/warmup/release in v2.26.x). Gray-world WB at strength 0.5 for the heat-lamp scene. | `source: snapshot`, `snapshot_method: http_url` via `HttpUrlSnapshotSource` (v2.26.0, 5 s cadence) | off | Brooder interior (heat-lamp lit) |
| `gwtc` | Built-in webcam on the Gateway laptop ("Hy-HD-Camera", 720p max) | Gateway laptop (Windows 11) | `192.168.0.68` (DHCP — drifts on reboot; find by service signature on `:8554`, see "Finding a drifted host" below) | `rtsp://192.168.0.68:8554/gwtc` (TCP — published by `ffmpeg` via DirectShow → MediaMTX v1.12.2) | `rtsp_url_override`, OpenCV `VideoCapture` | off | Coop interior |
| `iphone-cam` | Boss's iPhone 16 Pro Max via Apple Continuity Camera (USB or wireless to the Mac Mini) — **opportunistic**, only present when the phone is hooked up | Mac Mini "Bubba" (`192.168.0.71`) running a second `usb-cam-host` instance | `127.0.0.1:8091` (loopback, mini-only) | `http://127.0.0.1:8091/photo.jpg` — same `usb-cam-host` binary as the Logitech path, but with `USB_CAM_DEVICE_NAME_CONTAINS=iPhone` so the grabber resolves the AVFoundation video device whose name contains "iPhone" instead of using a raw index. When no iPhone is enumerated by AVFoundation, `_open()` returns `None` and the grabber idles → `/photo.jpg` returns 503 → consumers retry, no spam. **Cannot fall through to "Capture screen 0"** thanks to the substring gate plus a defensive screen-name filter in the resolver. | `source: snapshot`, `snapshot_method: http_url` via `HttpUrlSnapshotSource` (10 s cadence — opportunistic, not surveillance) | off | Whatever Boss is pointing the phone at — typically birds for portraits |
| ~~`mba-cam`~~ | ~~MacBook Air 2013 FaceTime HD~~ — **DECOMMISSIONED 2026-04-15 09:16 ET.** MBA repurposed by Boss for unrelated work. MBA LaunchAgents (`com.farmguardian.mba-cam`, `com.farmguardian.mediamtx`, `com.farmguardian.usb-cam-host`) all `launchctl bootout`'d and any stragglers `pkill -9`'d; plists left in place on the MBA so the camera node can be resurrected with a single `launchctl load` if Boss ever puts it back in the network. Removed from Guardian's `config.json`; set `enabled: false` in `tools/pipeline/config.json` (kept the block so it can be flipped back without re-deriving it). | — | — | — | — | — |

**Live frame sizes (2026-04-14 11:02 — as pulled through `/api/cameras/<name>/frame`):** `house-yard` ~1.4 MB (native 4K JPEG); `usb-cam` ~420 KB (1080p, libjpeg quality 95); `gwtc` ~120 KB (720p H.264 re-encoded); `mba-cam` ~115 KB (720p H.264 re-encoded); `s7-cam` ~950 KB (1920×1080 IP Webcam JPEG, served via HTTP snapshot pull now that v2.24.0 is live on the phone).

## What Runs Where

| Machine | LAN IP | OS | Services running for Guardian | Other services (for context) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mac Mini "Bubba"** | `192.168.0.71` (WiFi/en1, currently — see drift note) | macOS 26.3, 14-core M4 Pro, 64 GB | `guardian.py` (manual `nohup`, PID varies — all camera consumers + YOLOv8 + the FastAPI dashboard on `:6530`); `tools.pipeline.orchestrator` daemon (manual `nohup`, VLM enrichment of archived frames); **`iphone-cam-host` LaunchAgent on `:8091` (`com.farmguardian.iphone-cam-host`, v2.28.x — serves `/photo.jpg` from Boss's iPhone via Continuity Camera, name-gated on substring "iPhone"; idles cleanly when no iPhone is enumerated)**; `usb-cam-host` LaunchAgent on `:8089` (`com.farmguardian.usb-cam-host`, present but currently unloaded — USB cam lives on the MBA at the moment); `cloudflared` tunnel publishing `:6530` to `guardian.markbarney.net` (outbound, no port forward needed) | LM Studio on `:1234` (GLM-4.6v-Flash + others); dev loop for this repo and `farm-2026` |
| **Gateway laptop ("GWTC")** | `192.168.0.68` (WiFi, DHCP) | Windows 11 Home 10.0.22631 (hostname `653Pudding`) | `mediamtx` Shawl service on `:8554` (declares the `gwtc` path in `C:\mediamtx\mediamtx.yml`); `farmcam` Shawl service (wraps `C:\farm-services\start-camera.bat` → ffmpeg dshow `Hy-HD-Camera` → push to `rtsp://localhost:8554/gwtc`); `farmcam-watchdog` Shawl service (auto-recovery for the post-reboot dshow-zombie pattern — see `docs/13-Apr-2026-gwtc-laptop-troubleshooting-incident.md`); Windows OpenSSH Server | LM Studio on `:9099` (non-standard — NOT 1234). Windows Firewall is DISABLED per `network.md`. |
| **MacBook Air 2013** | `192.168.0.50` (WiFi, DHCP) | macOS Big Sur 11.7.11 (hardware ceiling — no upgrade possible), Intel Core i5 Haswell 1.3 GHz, 8 GB, Python 3.8.9 from `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/` | **NONE — MBA repurposed by Boss 2026-04-15.** All three farmguardian LaunchAgents (`mediamtx`, `mba-cam`, `usb-cam-host`) are `bootout`'d; plists remain on disk at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` for future resurrection (`launchctl load ...`). Runtime at `~/.local/farm-services/usb-cam-host/` (venv + script) also left in place. No farm code runs on this box until Boss puts it back in. | Screensaver disabled (`idleTime=0`, `askForPassword=0`); `pmset sleep=0 disksleep=0 displaysleep=0 standby=0 powernap=0 hibernatemode=0 autorestart=1`. These power-management tweaks were applied for the farm role; Boss may want to revert them for the device's next use. |
| **Reolink E1 Outdoor Pro** | `192.168.0.88` (WiFi) | Reolink firmware | The camera itself — ONVIF on `:8000`, HTTP API on `:80`, RTSP on `:554`. Uses HTTP snapshot path now (RTSP was abandoned — lossy WiFi mangled HEVC reference packets; see CHANGELOG v2.16.0-v2.18.0). | Camera auto-spotlight and auto-tracking run on the camera itself. Guardian layers YOLO detection + coordinated Discord alerts on top. |
| **Samsung Galaxy S7** | `192.168.0.249` (WiFi) | Android 8.0.0 + IP Webcam (`com.pas.webcam`) | The phone — serves HTTP `/photo.jpg` on `:8080` (pull-on-demand, battery-sparing v2.24.0 path). | **2026-04-14 correction:** prior docs and HARDWARE_INVENTORY said the phone had been running IP Webcam all along, but when Boss turned it on to flip to http_url mode, the actual installed app was **RTSP Camera Server (`com.miv.rtspcamera`)** — an RTSP-only app with **no** `/photo.jpg` endpoint and an auto-record-to-disk feature that had filled `/sdcard/RTSPRecords` with 19 GB of loops. That's the real reason "continuous RTSP drained the battery" — RTSP Camera Server was the wrong app. Recovery: adb over USB through the MBA, delete recordings, install IP Webcam from Aptoide (MD5-verified), launch, `svc power stayon true`, uninstall `com.miv.rtspcamera`, flip `config.json` to `http_url`. Documented in `docs/13-Apr-2026-s7-phone-setup.md` (updated with the correction). |

**Not Guardian hosts but on the LAN** (per `~/bubba-workspace/memory/reference/network.md`): Boss's MSI Katana 15 HX at `192.168.0.3` (primary workstation); Larry's MSI laptop at `192.168.0.194` (OpenClaw node, separate project); Boss's iPhone at `192.168.0.134`; Boss's Apple Watch at `192.168.0.227`. None of these participate in Guardian.

```

`guardian.markbarney.net` is a Cloudflare Tunnel from the Mac Mini — outbound-only, no port forwarding, no inbound firewall rule. The tunnel exposes `:6530` (FastAPI dashboard + REST API) to the public internet; the frontend at `farm.markbarney.net` embeds JPEGs from `<tunnel>/api/cameras/<name>/frame` every ~1.2 s.

## Naming Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE — mirrored in Bubba auto-memory `feedback_camera_naming.md`)

1. **Camera names are device-only.** `mba-cam`, `s7-cam`, `usb-cam`, `gwtc`. The grandfathered exception is `house-yard` (predates the rule). **Never** `brooder-cam`, `nestbox`, `coop-cam`, `incubator-cam`, or any other "where it is today" string.
2. **The rule applies to every layer.** The `name` field in `config.json`, RTSP paths, MediaMTX `paths:` declarations, ffmpeg push URLs, LaunchAgent labels, Shawl service names, log filenames, dashboard labels, the frontend `lib/cameras.ts` entries (`label`, `shortLabel`, `device`), MDX roster tables, thumbnail captions, stage overlays — **every string a user or future agent can see**. The 13-Apr-2026 incident that hit hardest: `lib/cameras.ts` had `shortLabel: "Brooder"` for `usb-cam`, `"S7 brooder"` for `s7-cam`, `"MBA brooder"` for `mba-cam`, `"Nestbox"` for `gwtc` — three thumbnails all said "brooder," frontend devs found them indistinguishable. Fix was to drop any `location` field entirely and label by hardware (`"USB"`, `"MBA"`, `"S7"`, `"GWTC"`, `"Reolink"`).
3. **The rule applies to publish paths too.** As of 2026-04-13 evening, the Gateway laptop's MediaMTX path was renamed `nestbox` → `gwtc` to match the device name (CHANGELOG v2.24.1). The MacBook Air's path was always `mba-cam`. If anyone adds a new ffmpeg → MediaMTX node, the path **must** equal the camera's `name` in `config.json`.
4. **"Where it's pointed today" is field-note material, not config material.** Put it in a `content/field-notes/*.mdx` entry, a CHANGELOG line, or a photo caption if needed. Don't put it in any struct that drives UI, routing, services, or file names. The rightmost column of this file ("Currently aimed at") is allowed precisely because it's in a doc that's read by humans once, not parsed by machines repeatedly.

## Adding a New Camera (checklist)

1. **Pick the device-name first.** Must not be a location. Short, lowercase, hyphenated. If you can't think of a device name, you haven't thought about it hard enough (`raspicam-1`, `eufy-coop`, `arlo-gate`, etc.).
2. **`config.json` + `config.example.json`** — add the entry. Required: `name`, `ip`, `port`, `username`/`password` if any, `type` (`ptz` or `fixed`), capture config (`source` + `snapshot_method` + method-specific keys OR `rtsp_url_override` + `rtsp_transport`), `detection_enabled` (default `false` until role is decided). `rtsp_transport: tcp` for any WiFi-published camera; only use `udp` if you have hard evidence UDP is stable on that specific camera.
3. **If the camera is published via ffmpeg → MediaMTX on a host machine** — the MediaMTX `paths:` block in the host's `mediamtx.yml` **must** declare the path, the ffmpeg push URL **must** push to that path, and **the path must equal the camera's `name`**. Save canonical copies of the host's config in `deploy/<host>/` so they're version controlled.
4. **Update this file.** Add the row to "The Five Cameras" (update the count in the section header if needed — currently "Five" — or just renumber mentally). Add the host to "What Runs Where" if it's a new machine. Update "Where Each Camera's Frame Lands in the Stack." Update the "Last verified" stamp at the top.
5. **Update `farm-2026/lib/cameras.ts`** — new entry with `name`, `label`, `shortLabel`, `device`, `aspectRatio`. **No `location` field.** Labels and short labels are hardware-only. Update `farm-2026/content/projects/guardian/index.mdx` cameras table.
6. **Restart Guardian** on the Mini (`kill <pid>; nohup ./venv/bin/python guardian.py >> guardian.log 2>&1 & disown`). Verify: `curl -s http://localhost:6530/api/cameras` should list the new camera with `online: true, capturing: true`. Then `curl -s -o /tmp/t.jpg -w "%{http_code} %{size_download}\n" http://localhost:6530/api/cameras/<name>/frame` should return `200` and a JPEG ≥5 KB within ~2 capture intervals.
7. **Restart the pipeline daemon too** (`tools.pipeline.orchestrator`) — it reads its own `tools/pipeline/config.json` at startup. If the new camera should be enriched by the VLM, add it there too.

## Moving an Existing Camera

**Don't rename anything.** The camera's `name`, RTSP path, MediaMTX path, LaunchAgent labels, Shawl service names, log filenames, and config entry all stay exactly as they were. The only things that change are:

1. The rightmost "Currently aimed at" column in this file.
2. A field-note MDX in `farm-2026/content/field-notes/` describing the new placement and why.
3. Optionally the `context` string in `tools/pipeline/config.json` (VLM prompt context — should still lead with the hardware, e.g., "MacBook Air 2013 (Big Sur, 192.168.0.50) built-in FaceTime HD webcam; currently aimed at...").

If you find yourself wanting to rename the camera because it moved: re-read rule #1. You're about to reintroduce the exact problem this file exists to prevent.

## Mac Mini Network Drift (note flagged 2026-04-13)

`~/bubba-workspace/memory/reference/network.md` states the intended Mac Mini config is **en0 Ethernet at `192.168.0.105` with WiFi OFF**. Actual runtime (verified 2026-04-13 19:08): **en1 WiFi at `192.168.0.71`, en0 Ethernet disconnected**. Everything still works — Guardian binds `0.0.0.0:6530` so it's reachable on whatever interface has a route, and the Cloudflare tunnel is outbound-only so it's transport-agnostic — but:

- ICMP-asymmetry rules in `CLAUDE.md` assume Mini-on-Ethernet ↔ laptop-on-WiFi. With both sides on WiFi, `ping` may actually work between the Mini and GWTC/Air, which **inverts the usual "TCP-only probes" guidance** for that specific pairing. Don't build diagnostic habits around the current state; the Ethernet cable might be plugged back in at any time.
- The pipeline daemon's reads of `/gwtc` show up in the Gateway laptop's mediamtx log as coming from `192.168.0.71`. That's the Mini on WiFi, not an unknown consumer.
- If the front-end dashboard (`farm-2026`) displays the Mini's IP anywhere in its system panel, it's pulling it from the Guardian API — which will report the current IP correctly.

**Not fixing this in code.** It's a physical-layer state that Boss controls. Flag for Boss's attention next time the Mini is within arm's reach.

## Finding a Drifted Host

`gwtc` and `mba-cam`'s hosts are both on DHCP. IPs drift after router reboots or long WiFi disassociations. Don't trust the IP in this file as a live value; trust the **service signature**:

```bash
# GWTC: distinctive services on :8554 (MediaMTX) or :9099 (LM Studio, non-standard)
for i in $(seq 2 254); do (nc -z -w 1 192.168.0.$i 8554 2>/dev/null && echo "192.168.0.$i has :8554") & done; wait

# MacBook Air: also publishes MediaMTX on :8554 (so both the Air and GWTC will show up;
# disambiguate by SSH user — Air is `markb@<ip>` with key auth, or by checking the RTSP
# path it serves: gwtc vs mba-cam).

# Mac Mini: reachable on the LAN, usually known; for belt-and-suspenders, sweep :6530
# (Guardian dashboard) or check the Cloudflare tunnel (publicly reachable).
for i in $(seq 2 254); do (nc -z -w 1 192.168.0.$i 6530 2>/dev/null && echo "192.168.0.$i has :6530 (Guardian)") & done; wait
```
